## "Hi, my name is Thomas Herrera and I spark imagination and inspiration in users through the use of creating3D content. I do this by building apps and 3D environments using tools such as Maya, Substance Painter/Designer,  Unreal Engine, Zbrush and Java. I would love to meet with you and explore how to achieve my goals."

## Passion Project

* to work on a triple A videogame that illicits an emotional response that challenges the players view on the world. I want to spark their imagination and creativity to continue to explore a 3D world that I built. A playground that is built to tell a story.

## Collaboration Question Answer

* The way that I work in a team is by making sure everyone is working effectively.I feel that it is very important for everyone to knoe what they are working on. My main role will be front-end development and the implementation of augmented reality in the app. My background of being a 3D Artist is very pivotal here that allows us to implement this idea. Moreover, my triggers would be seeing one of my team members fall behind because my grade depends on the whole team doing well. But, I feel that my communication skill will help me overcome this issue. I feel that it is important to help others become the best that they can be instead of putting them down. So I would work with them to help them overcome their obstacle.

  ## Identify two orgs
  
  1. New Mexico Museum of Art.
	
     * Mary Kershaw-Director.
	Phone: 505-476-5073
	http://nmartmuseum.org/
	I selected this company because I am a big advocate for art. I feel that many people don’t appreciate art because it is tough for them to understand their true beauty. I feel that the museum of art would benefit from creating new experiences that push the beauty of the artwork there. I feel that displaying some pieces in Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality would help immerse visitors to connect with the art on display in new and engaging mediums. 
My strategy to meet with them is to build a demo to show my ideas to implement 3D recreations and implementation. I would make calls and pitch my idea; including visiting the museum and getting information so that I understand how my idea would benefit them.

2. California Pastrami.

I selected California Pastrami because they don’t have a personal app that would help customers place orders quickly and easily. They would benefit from a personal app to take orders online easily without the need to search a website on the phone.They are a local business with 3 locations and I feel that they have great food. I would give the owner a call and pitch them my idea. They are a young business that is growing, and I feel that they would benefit from an app.


## Stovetop Activity

1. Get hired
2. Build on the necessary skillset
3. Build a project that shows my skillset.
4. Build an online presence




  
  ## Weekly Reflection.
  
  1. There is so much to learn and so little time. This week I have learned a lot but it seems that the mountain of info is getting bigger faster then I can process. I have learned about Types, Primitives, Methods, Classes, and Instances. However, as I learn more questions arise. But, I feel that the way that I think about problems are changing. I am starting to think how I can present solutions into Java code so that I can write my own methods. Overall, learning Java is like a blurry image that is slowly becoming more clear everyday that passes.
  
  2. This week has had many highs and many lows. In the beginning of the week I felt like I was falling behind. The daily activities were not making sense and I felt lost. I was woried that I couldn't keep up. But, as I was reviewing the book, everything fell into place. It all made sense. It felt amazing to connect the dots of the reading and the excercises we were doing in class.
  
  3. This week it is getting harder to manage family time and studying. The material is making more sense and there is so much that I am learning. However, it is causing some stress at home. I am unable to give the same attention to my family right now. I was unaware of this issue because I was so focused on my learning. But, I have made some changes to spend some more quality time with my family. Although, this doesn't fix the situation, it helps to ease their stress and help them cope with my new schedule.
  
  4. This week was very hectic due to the test on Friday. I made sure to prioritize studying which did put my other classes on hold until the weekend. However,a lot of the ideas were making more sense, specifically the logic for finding the solution for problems in coding. One thing that has been very helpful has been learning how to debug my code. That has been the greatest learning tool that I have access to. Additionally, finishing the test has given me the confidence that I am right on track in the Bootcamp. 
  
  4. This week has been stressful due to the amount of work that I have. I am currently doing the bootcamp and doing online classes full-time. Moreover, the online work is a heavy workload for the current class. It has been tough to manage my time this week for both. The bootcamp is my main priority during the week but the online course is my main priority on the weekend. It is almost too much to handle but I am managing.
