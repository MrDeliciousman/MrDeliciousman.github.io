  ## Identify two orgs
  
  1. New Mexico Museum of Art.
	
     * Mary Kershaw-Director.
	Phone: 505-476-5073
	http://nmartmuseum.org/
	I selected this company because I am a big advocate for art. I feel that many people don’t appreciate art because it is tough for them to understand their true beauty. I feel that the museum of art would benefit from creating new experiences that push the beauty of the artwork there. I feel that displaying some pieces in Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality would help immerse visitors to connect with the art on display in new and engaging mediums. 
My strategy to meet with them is to build a demo to show my ideas to implement 3D recreations and implementation. I would make calls and pitch my idea; including visiting the museum and getting information so that I understand how my idea would benefit them.

2. California Pastrami.

I selected California Pastrami because they don’t have a personal app that would help customers place orders quickly and easily. They would benefit from a personal app to take orders online easily without the need to search a website on the phone.They are a local business with 3 locations and I feel that they have great food. I would give the owner a call and pitch them my idea. They are a young business that is growing, and I feel that they would benefit from an app.


## Stovetop Activity

1. Get hired

  ## Weekly Reflection.
  
  1. There is so much to learn and so little time. This week I have learned a lot but it seems that the mountain of info is getting bigger faster then I can process. I have learned about Types, Primitives, Methods, Classes, and Instances. However, as I learn more questions arise. But, I feel that the way that I think about problems are changing. I am starting to think how I can present solutions into Java code so that I can write my own methods. Overall, learning Java is like a blurry image that is slowly becoming more clear everyday that passes.
  
  2. This week has had many highs and many lows. In the beginning of the week I felt like I was falling behind. The daily activities were not making sense and I felt lost. I was woried that I couldn't keep up. But, as I was reviewing the book, everything fell into place. It all made sense. It felt amazing to connect the dots of the reading and the excercises we were doing in class.
  
  3. This week it is getting harder to manage family time and studying. The material is making more sense and there is so much that I am learning. However, it is causing some stress at home. I am unable to give the same attention to my family right now. I was unaware of this issue because I was so focused on my learning. But, I have made some changes to spend some more quality time with my family. Although, this doesn't fix the situation, it helps to ease their stress and help them cope with my new schedule.
